**15-418: Project Proposal**

**TITLE** : Parallelizing the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm

**SUMMARY** :

The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is an optimization algorithm which mimics the foraging behavior of bees. We will parallelize this algorithm on multi-core CPU platforms using Open-MP and Open-MPI and analyze their performances.

**BACKGROUND** :

An explanation of the algorithm:

The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is a well known and commonly used algorithm when it comes to optimization problems. It was created based on how honey bee swarms have intelligent foraging behaviour. In the basic version of the model, the bees are split into 3 different groups: employed bees, onlookers bees, and scout bees. A main assumption is that there is one food source for each employed bee. The employed bees carry information regarding the food source and then share this information to other bees through their dancing. If an employed bees&#39; food source is abandoned, they will become a scout and search for a new food source. The onlooker bees gain information regarding the food sources and choose them through the dances.

Basic algorithm looks like:

1. Initialize food sources for each employed bee
2. Repeat/loop the following

1. Every employed bee goes to its associated food source and determines how much honey is at the food source then goes to dance in the hive
2. Each onlooker bee watches the dances and selects a food source through a greedy strategy and goes to that source. After it picks a neighbour around it, it determines how much honey is in the neighbour.
3. Figure out which are the abandoned food sources and replace them with new food sources found by the scout bees.
4. Store information about best food source

1. Loop until requirements for best food source are met or until a certain number of iterations

The three main places in which this algorithm can and will be parallelized is 1. Initialization, 2.1. Employed bee tasks and 2.2 onlooker bee tasks.

**THE CHALLENGE:**

The original or sequential ABC algorithm is known to have a slow speed of convergence, a long search time, and can lead to issues of falling into local optimums at the end of a search. It will be difficult to adjust the algorithm such that the solution isn&#39;t stuck at a local optimum at the end of a search. One way we aim to try to fix this problem is through simulated annealing.

Furthermore, what may make it difficult to parallelize is the information that needs to be shared across processors within the stages through shared memory or message passing. We need to make sure that there aren&#39;t multiple processors writing to the same data. We also need to make sure that we divide/parallelize across the best axis possible, and will try different strategies when designing the size of the bee swarm and dividing the bee types such that the workload is as efficient and evenly distributed as possible across the processors.

Additionally, since we are trying both OpenMP and OpenMPI, another challenging aspect is that we will have to make sure that our algorithm can handle information sharing through either shared memory or message passing. This will also allow us to be able to see which strategy allows the greatest speedup.

**RESOURCES** :

We will be using the multi-core nodes on the GHC and Bridges PSC machines. We will use the Open-MP and Open-MPI libraries but we will build and write the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm from scratch in C++.

**GOALS AND DELIVERABLES** :

Plan to Achieve (100% completion):

- Optimization of the ABC algorithm for better accuracy and performance in general
- Implementation of a parallel ABC algorithm using Open-MP
- Implementation of a parallel ABC algorithm using Open-MPI
- Detailed analysis and comparison of both implementations

Hope to Achieve (125% completion):

- Implementation of parallel ABC algorithm using CUDA
- Analysis of CUDA implementation vs Open-MP and Open-MPI
- Step-by-step visualization of the ABC algorithm

Sub-MVP (75% completion):

- Optimization of the ABC algorithm for better accuracy and performance in general
- Implementation and analysis of ABC algorithm using Open-MP

Our final analysis will include speedup graphs and graphs comparing our various implementations of the parallel algorithm and sequential algorithm. We plan on answering which implementation results in the largest speedup/which is most efficient and how many threads for the corresponding implementation leads to these results.

**PLATFORM CHOICE:**

Computer: The ABC algorithm that we are implementing involves many different kinds of bees processes) performing independent work but also communicating with each other. Therefore, we chose the GHC and Bridges PSC machines because they have multi-core CPU functionality which works well for our use case.

Language: We are going to use C++ as it allows us to leverage the Open-MP and Open-MPI libraries to create a multi-threaded algorithm to run on the cores.

**Milestone Report:**

- In one to two paragraphs, summarize the work that you have completed so far. (This should be easy if you have been maintaining this information on your project page.)

So far, we&#39;ve completed researching and implementing a sequential version of the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. We looked at different papers describing the algorithm and a few different implementations as well. These resources have helped us implement a general version of the algorithm. For example, to use our implementation you just need to define an arbitrary objective function with an arbitrary number of parameters to optimize. The ABC algorithm will find the parameters that minimize the function. We have also tested the algorithm with different hyper-parameters (such as number of trials and bee colony size) to try to find the optimal hyper-parameters.

We have started working on implementing an open-MP version of the algorithm. We are currently identifying parallelizable work in our algorithm and will parallelize the code and analyze the speedup.

- Describe how you are doing with respect to the goals and deliverables stated in your proposal. Do you still believe you will be able to produce all your deliverables? If not, why? What about the &quot;nice to haves&quot; ? In your milestone writeup we want an updated list of goals that you plan to hit for the poster session.

We are slightly behind with respect to the goals and deliverables stated in our proposal, as we are still working on the Open-MP implementation. We think as long as we don&#39;t hit any massive issues with our Open-MP and Open-MPI implementations, we should be on track to produce our deliverables. However, we are unsure if we will be able to have our stretch goals (&quot;nice to haves&quot;) done in time for the final presentation, as it will definitely be a stretch to complete an entire other parallel implementation in time. Goals are still the same as from the proposal, nothing to update.

- What do you plan to show at the poster session? Will it be a demo? Will it be a graph?

We plan to have several graphs that analyze our work as there isn&#39;t much of a visual aspect to the project. We just run the code and it prints out numbers, so no demo aspect. Instead there will be graph based posters analyzing different statistics such as speedup, variance to fine tuned hyper parameters, etc.

- Do you have preliminary results at this time? If so, it would be great to included them in your milestone write-up.

Our preliminary results are that our sequential code currently works and is able to find the minima of testing functions including one called the sphere function.

- List the issues that concern you the most. Are there any remaining unknowns (things you simply don&#39;t know how to solve, or resource you don&#39;t know how to get) or is it just a matter of coding and doing the work? If you do not wish to put this information on a public web site you are welcome to email the staff directly.

One of the biggest concerns we had was determining the right values for the parameters to the optimization problems. Since we have many parameters that are required to find the best possible solution we have to fine tune those values such that they are optimal for the function we are trying to optimize. Although this is less a part of our implementation and more a part of our testing, it is still a valid concern to work on. Although our sequential code works and optimizes, since we are using different testing functions, each function will have separate parameters, like the number of iterations and trials.
