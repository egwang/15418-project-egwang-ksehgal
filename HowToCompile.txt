15-418: How To Compile:

OpenMp: 
g++ -m64 -std=c++11 -I. -O3 -Wall -fopenmp -g -o abc_mp ABC_MP.cpp
Then followed by ./abc_mp 1000 10 1 (where last parameter is numThreads)

OpenMPI:
just type make (I put in a make file)
then followed by mpirun -np 1 ./abc_mpi 1000 10
where after -np flag is number of threads
